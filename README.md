# Analysis of Tensile Testing Data

In this project, groups of up five students used raw data from a series of three experiments to determine tensile properties of the materials. As a group you will develop an analysis strategy for the data. Then each member of the group needs to write their own brief (~2 page) executive summary of the project results. The requirements for this document are detailed below.

The Investigation
We had been given three sets of data from your testing laboratory that have been performed on the “same material with the same methods.” Our task is to analyze the data and to critically evaluate their quality. When there are problems with the data quality, we would need to identify possible sources of error and ways to make things better in the future. The details of the materials, specimens, and testing parameters are in the summary file (file name: Group#-DataSummary.pdf). The raw data referred to in the summary file will be in the comma delimetered files names Group#Raw1.csv, Group#Raw2.csv, and Group#Raw3.csv.
